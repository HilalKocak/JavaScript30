### JavaScript References and Copying
#### Strings, numbers, and booleans can be easily assigned to each other. When one of them changes, the others do not

#### Arrays and objects work differently. If any assignment happens, the other variable becomes a reference, and when one of them is changed, the other one changes too.

#### Used methods:
- [].concat
- Array.from
- {...object}
- Object.assign
- JSON.parse(JSON.stringify, object)
