### JavaScript References and Copying
#### strings, numbers and booleans can easily assign to each other. When one of them changed, the other not.

#### arrays and objects work differently. If any assignment happens, the other variable becomes reference and when the one of them change, the other one change too.

#### Used methods:
- [].concat
- Array.from
- {...object}
- Object.assign
- JSON.parse(JSON.stringify, object)
