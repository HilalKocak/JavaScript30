    let age2 = age;

    age2 = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team)
    team[3] = 'Hilal' // players[3] = Hilal changed too
    console.log(players, team)


    // and we want to make a copy of it.




    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    console.log("***********")
    const team2 = players.slice() // returns entire array
    // players[0] = 'changed'
    console.log(players, team2)
   
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    console.log("***********")
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    //players[0] = 'changed2'
    console.log(players, team3);
   
   
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    console.log("***********")
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = "ES6"
    console.log(players, team4)

    // or with Array.from
    console.log("***********")
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[0] = "Array.from"
    console.log(team5, players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99; // person changed too

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age : 12}); // addded new property to object
    console.log("cap2", cap2)
    console.log("original object", person)

    // object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}
    cap3["name"] = 'hilal kocak'
    console.log("cap3", cap3)
    console.log("person", person)


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    console.log("dev", dev)
    dev.name = "wes"
    console.log(hilal)

    dev.social.twitter = '@devtwitter' // now! hilal is changed too. Because one level reference the inner are working like reference
    // object assign works one level copy, inners are reference

    // the way of inner elements copy
