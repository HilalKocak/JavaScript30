### Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling and Once
- Nested elements are triggered from the inside outwards. When set the capture: true, event starts from the outermost element and propagates inwards to the innermost element.
- To prevent triggering from bubbling, you can use the stopPropagation feature.
-  If you want the event listener to be triggered only once, you can use once parameter.
